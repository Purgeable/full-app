[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mini-kep/full-app.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/mini-kep/full-app)

# full-app
Keep all functionality for (parsers + db + frontend API)  inside one Django project.


Suggested components:

1. Parser yields datapoints based on call with varname and frequency.
   Can yield random values for a prototype.

2. Import broker calls parser and stores datapoints in database.

3. Database stores datapoints. For simlicity overwrite existing datapoints with newer ones.

4. End user API allows querying database to by varname/frequency

Simplifications:
- No time limits
- Same API to enduser and to parser


## Django Rest API project: mini-kep

    git clone https://github.com/mini-kep/full-app.git full-app
    cd full-app
    pip install -r requirements.txt

#### Run the project:
    python manage.py runserver

#### Login:
    http://localhost:8000/auth/login/?next=/
    user: admin
    pass: asdasdasd

    http://localhost:8000/api/datapoints/
   
#### API page:
    http://localhost:8000/api/

#### Tests:
